# Overview
This is built for .NET 2.0 onwards and is entirely C# (no external dependencies). No installation is required either; it 'just works' from whatever directory the exe is in.

# Build Instructions
There are two build options; either the library, which you can embed in existing software, or the standalone which can be directly run on e.g. mono or .NET. If you're building on Windows, simply double click the .bat for the build you want. For linux users, you'll need to have installed 'mono-complete' (e.g. apt-get install mono-complete) and can then run the .sh files or directly run the one line command inside them.
