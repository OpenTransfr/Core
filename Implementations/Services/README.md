# ServicesIn here are the reference implementations for the server end of the API's. They all share common functionality and can optionally be merged into one, essentially hosted together as one website.# To InstallTo install, first create a suitable website with HTTPS support.- If you don't have HTTPS, try using Let's Encrypt to obtain a free certificate.- The NGINX configuration files used by the reference implementations can be found in here too. These configuration files are also designed to 'just work' with Let's Encrypt; just make sure that you use a suitable SSL file path and hostname.- Upload the 'Common' files to the website. Edit the private/settings.php file with your entity's settings.- Upload the Service files of your choice into the private/Pages folder.
