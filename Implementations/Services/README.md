# ServicesIn here are the reference implementations for the server end of the API's. They all share common functionality and can optionally be merged into one, essentially hosted together as one website.# StatusThe current status of the services are as follows:Issuer: *Unstable*. Hosted reference at https://issuer.opentrans.fr/.OpenBank: *Unstable*. Hosted reference at https://bank.opentrans.fr/.OpenPay: *Unstable*. Hosted reference at https://pay.opentrans.fr/.Root: *Unstable*. Hosted reference at https://root.opentrans.fr/.Regulator: *Unstable*. Hosted reference at https://regulator.opentrans.fr/.Reason(s): The current specifications are stabilising but are regularly changing. Full testing won't be performed until the first draft of the specifications stabilise.# To InstallTo install, first create a suitable website with HTTPS support.- If you don't have HTTPS, try using Let's Encrypt to obtain a free certificate.- Create an entity if you need one. See https://txroot.opentrans.fr/#screen=entity.create- The NGINX configuration files used by the reference implementations can be found in here too. These configuration files are also designed to 'just work' with Let's Encrypt; just make sure that you use a suitable SSL file path and hostname.- Upload the 'Common' files to the website. Edit the private/settings.php file with your entity's settings.- You'll need a secp256k1 implementation installed. These implementations use the https://github.com/Bit-Wasp/secp256k1-php library, which is a PHP wrapper for the Bitcoin secp256k1 C library. If you wish to use another, you'll only need to edit the Common/private/Functions/cryptography.php file.- Upload the Service files of your choice into the private/Pages folder.
