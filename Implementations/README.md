# Implementations
Reference implementations of the various API's. The primary reference languages are:

- C#
- PHP*
- Javascript

# PHP? Why PHP?
The API's are built around web technologies. PHP was chosen for the reference implementation of those API's as it's a language many web developers can recognise and easily understand; A less popular language may otherwise result in aspects of the design being 'lost in translation'.
