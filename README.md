# OpenTransfr
OpenTransfr is a free, fast and open payment network. There's no transaction fees, the network is distributed and it can perform transactions using any commodity such as existing currencies. Say hello to the future of payments.

# Brief overview
The OpenTransfr network is a little like DNS. In order to allow the network to scale and to ensure network safety, a hierarchy of distributed nodes is used. The root nodes are the most secure and well trusted systems on the network and they must agree in order for transactions to complete. They each contain a copy of all address balances along with about 5 days worth of transaction history. Broadcast nodes connect to the root nodes and repeat the transactions that were accepted by the root. Archive nodes store the full history of all transactions. Any node can submit a transaction request to the network. 

# Appreciations
OpenTransfr would like to thank the Bitcoin and Stellar communities. This network adopts concepts from both whilst forking neither as OpenTransfr is constructed with a hierarchy.
