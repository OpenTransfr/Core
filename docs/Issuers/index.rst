Issuer
======

Issuers define a commodity and issue them onto the network. There is only ever *one issuer per commodity*. This is so it can guarentee a withdrawal from the network, but more on that later. Usually, anyone can be an issuer but there are some special exceptions. For example, traditional currencies are restricted - the central bank that normally issues the currency decides who issues it on the network. In most cases, the central bank itself is the best issuer. However, you can create your own virtual currency or commodity and issue it however you want.

Anonymous issuing
-----------------

The network has many properties which are favourable to a political voting system. For example, transparency, anonymity within the root and the ability for anyone to view transactions live. If we view votes as a kind of currency, and the action of voting for something is a transfer, an interesting usage of the network begins to emerge. However, there are a few key components that would be required in order for such a system to be widely possible. A Government (or anyone who wishes to run a vote) would be the issuer of votes, and would need to only issue them to users who are eligible to vote. Issuers always issue to a public address, however, as the flow of transactions from that public address are clearly visible, this would expose exactly who a particular user voted for to the Government. In order to avoid exposing this, anonymous issuing is required.
