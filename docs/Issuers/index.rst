Issuer
======

Issuers define a commodity and issue them onto the network. There is only ever *one issuer per commodity*. This is so it can guarentee a withdrawal from the network, but more on that later. Usually, anyone can be an issuer but there are some special exceptions. For example, traditional currencies are restricted - the central bank that normally issues the currency decides who issues it on the network. In most cases, the central bank itself is the best issuer. However, you can create your own virtual currency or commodity and issue it however you want.
