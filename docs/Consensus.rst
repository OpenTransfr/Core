How everybody agrees
====================

When a transaction is processed, everybody has to agree that it's valid. That involves checking that the request came from the owner as well as checking if there's enough funds available. The process behind a group of nodes collectively agreeing about a transaction is called consensus. With OpenTransfr, reaching consensus is simple and works like this:

In 2 phases, which can be potentially grouped up with other transactions, consensus is achieved. This mechanism is primarily applied to transactions, however it's also used when, for example, a company updates its information.
