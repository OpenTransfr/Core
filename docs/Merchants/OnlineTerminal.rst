Online Terminals
================

A merchant must simply embed a button on their website; the type of button varies depending on if they're creating a subscription or a one-off payment. When a user clicks or taps the button, it will either instantly complete the transaction (depending on the users own trust settings), or open a window hosted by the users bank which displays the summary and total to pay as usual, optionally asking for a pin depending on the bank. The button also comes with a series of API's which can be used to, for example, display prices in the users preferred currency.

Shopping carts
--------------

The same API also provides functionality to build shopping carts, making the process as easy as possible for both the merchant and consumer. This uses the same backend functionality as the other forms of terminals.
