Terminals
=========

A terminal is defined as a point where a merchant wants to take a payment. There's lots of different types of terminals as there are many places this happens, so this document summarises the main types of terminals and how they work on this network.

**Note:** All terminals on the OpenTransfr network *do not* actually handle a payment or bank details. See the individual terminal types to see how they work and why.
