Merchants
=========

Merchants have an ordinary bank account like anyone else, except they simply use the ::ref:`terminal<_terminals>`_ functionality to receive payments. In order to make tax considerably simpler and potentially entirely automated, all the required information for tax purposes can be found on the bank statement.

Salaries/ Wages
---------------

Typically salaries are handled as subscriptions. In effect, the company is subscribing to an employee's work. This way the payment is entirely automated and it can safely vary from month to month too. Using device privileges, a HR department can access these specific subscriptions.
